Build a web app called "IdeaTaken" (or placeholder name). 

The app allows entrepreneurs to type in a startup idea and instantly 
find out if it already exists by aggregating results from multiple 
real-world sources simultaneously.

## Core User Flow
1. User lands on a clean, minimal homepage with a single search input
2. User types their startup idea (e.g. "an app that tracks your water intake using AI")
3. App runs parallel checks across multiple sources
4. Results come back in a unified "Viability Dashboard" with a score and breakdown

## Checks to Run (in parallel)
- Domain availability (.com, .io, .ai, .co) via a domain lookup API
- App Store & Google Play search for similar apps
- Product Hunt search for existing launches
- Reddit search for discussions or existing products
- Google Trends interest level for the idea keywords
- GitHub search for open source projects doing the same thing
- Basic trademark search via USPTO

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API routes (Node.js)
- All source checks run in parallel using Promise.all()
- AI summarization layer: call the Claude API (or OpenAI) with all 
  raw results and return a structured JSON response containing:
    - overallScore (0-100)
    - verdict ("Taken", "Crowded", "Opportunity", "Wide Open")
    - topCompetitors (array of name + url + description)
    - keyRisks (array of strings)
    - recommendation (2-3 sentence summary)
- Database: Supabase for auth, user history, and result caching
- Deployment: Vercel

## Pages & Components
- Homepage: hero with search bar, how it works section, example results
- Results page: viability score (big visual number), verdict badge, 
  competitor cards, risk list, AI recommendation, share button
- Auth pages: sign up / login (via Supabase auth)
- Dashboard: saved searches history for logged in users

## Monetization
- Free tier: 3 searches per day, basic results
- Pro tier: unlimited searches, full detailed report, export to PDF, 
  saved history — gated behind Stripe subscription ($9/month)
- AdSense placeholder slots on free tier results page

## Key UX Details
- Results should feel fast — show a loading skeleton with live 
  progress indicators per source ("Checking App Store... ✓")
- Each source result shows as its own card with a status 
  (Found / Not Found / Similar Exists)
- Overall score is color coded: green (wide open), yellow (crowded), 
  red (taken)
- Share button generates a shareable card image of the result summary
- Mobile responsive

## Important
- Cache results in Supabase for 24 hours so repeat searches 
  don't re-run all API calls
- Rate limit free users to 3 searches per day tracked by IP + account
- All API calls have proper error handling and timeouts (5s max per source)
- If a source check fails, show it gracefully as "Unavailable" 
  rather than breaking the whole result
