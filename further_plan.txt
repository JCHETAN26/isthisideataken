1. Score Decomposition (most impactful thing you can build)
Instead of showing one novelty score, break it into visible sub-scores that add up to the final number. Something like:

App Store saturation → 3 direct competitors found → −18 pts
GitHub activity → 2 repos, both abandoned → −5 pts
Reddit sentiment → mostly problem-discussion, no solutions → +12 pts
Scholar / research gap → 0 papers on this specific angle → +15 pts
Final: 72 Blue Ocean

Now the user can follow the math. They might disagree with one component, but the logic is traceable. This alone kills 80% of the trust problem.

2. Live, Clickable Evidence Cards
Every source that influenced the score should surface as a card the user can open — not just a URL, but a short excerpt showing why it was relevant or why it was dismissed. The key distinction is showing dismissed results too. If your AI found 10 things and only 3 were truly relevant, showing all 10 with reasoning ("this was about food drones, not delivery logistics") is far more credible than hiding the noise.
This transforms your product from "trust us" to "here's our work."

3. The Challenge Layer — your biggest differentiator
This is the one no competitor will have easily. After the report, give the user a prompt: "Disagree with a finding? Tell us why." The AI then defends or concedes its position based on the user's argument.
If a user says "you missed this competitor" and pastes a URL, the system re-analyzes and either says "you're right, this shifts your score to 65" or "we considered this category but your angle differs because X."
The concession case is actually more trust-building than being right. An AI that can say "good catch, we've updated your report" feels honest. An AI that never budges feels defensive and brittle.

4. Confidence Tiers, not false precision
Stop showing decimal-level precision if your data density doesn't support it. Instead, show three tiers:

High confidence — 15+ sources, multiple platforms, recent data
Medium confidence — 5–14 sources, some gaps
Low confidence — sparse data, niche market, recommend manual research

Counterintuitively, admitting low confidence on some ideas makes your high confidence ratings feel more trustworthy. Users respect tools that know their limits.

5. The Methodology Page (underrated)
A single, plain-English page explaining exactly how the score is calculated — what sources are checked, what weights are applied, what counts as a "direct competitor" vs. a "adjacent product" — does a lot of heavy lifting before users even run their first scan. Founders are analytical people. They want to understand the system before they trust it.
